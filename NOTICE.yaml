This project contains code and ideas derived from the following open-source research projects:

---

**Gillis: Serving Large Neural Networks in Serverless
Functions with Automatic Model Partitioning**  
Original repository: https://github.com/MincYu/gillis-open-source  
Authors: Minchen Yu, Zhifeng Jiang, et al.

---

**HarmonyBatch: Batching multi-SLO DNN Inference with Heterogeneous Serverless Functions**   
Codebase repository: https://github.com/icloud-ecnu/HarmonyBatch
Authors: Jiabin Chen, Fei Xu, et al.

Modifications and extensions have been made to the original codebases. These include:

- Adaptation for Alibaba Cloud Function Compute
- GPU accelerator support
- Batched inference support
- Prewarming and performance logging
- Improvements to concurrency control and request retry
